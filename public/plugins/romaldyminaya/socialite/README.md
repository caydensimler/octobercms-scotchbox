#Socialite

`RomaldyMinaya.Socialite` provides a clean and beautiful experience for the developers allowing them to oAuth users using the most common Social Providers.

##Dependencies

> [Rainlab.User](https://octobercms.com/plugin/rainlab-user) [October.Drivers](https://octobercms.com/plugin/october-drivers)

##Main Purpose

To provide a High Quality Plugin to the OctoberCMS Users that is flexible enough to be extendable and maintainable across the time. By implementing the Official [Laravel\Socialite](https://github.com/laravel/socialite) package created by **Taylor Otwell** and maintained by the community, we allows user to OAuth authentication with Facebook, Twitter (Comming Soon), Google, and GitHub. 

##Integration

The **Socialite** plugin Requires the [Rainlab.User](https://octobercms.com/plugin/rainlab-user) plugin to operate since all the sesion data is handled with the `RainLab\User\Classes\AuthManager`. Also the `Laravel\Socialite` package was used to handle the interface communication between the OctoberCMS and the Social Providers.

##Vision

To increase the satisfaction provided by the user experience of OctoberCMS to my colleagues in the community.
