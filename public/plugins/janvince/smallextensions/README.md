Rainlab Blog is a great plugin, but none of my clients is happy with MarkDown syntax to edit posts.


#### Settings

* **WYSIWYG editor**

    * Enable to switch between default MarkDown or OctoberCMS's Rich editor.
    * Allows you to add custom toolbar buttons.

* **Change post author**

    * Adds post author field with administrators dropdown

* **Custom fields**
    * Adds selected extra fields to blog post editing page on More tab (available fields: API code, string, switch, date&time and Media image)
    * Allow to replace original featured images upload field with one featured image selectable from Media manager


## Rainlab.Pages Extension

> *OctoberCMS > Backend > Settings > Small Extensions > Static pages*

> *Depends on: [Rainlab.Pages](https://octobercms.com/index.php/plugin/rainlab-pages) plugin!*


#### Settings

* **Hide Content field**

    * Allow to hide default Content tab and field from Pages editing page.
    * Useful for those, who uses {variable} fields and are little bit confused with default secondary content tab.
    * As of **version 1.2.17 of Rainlab.Pages plugin** custom fields are placed in secondary tabs container by default - by allow *Hide Content field*, all custom fields will be moved to primary tabs container.

* **Enable Menu notes**

    * If on, new tab Notes and a field Note is added to Menu items editing popup window.
    * text is then accessible from page/layout from {{item.viewBag.note}}.


## Twig Extensions

#### New functions

* **getImageSizeAttributes(image)**
 * Get image dimensions for use in ````<img>```` tag like: ````<img src="{{image.getPath}}" {{getImageSizeAttributes(image)}}>````
 * Will output ````<img ... width="123" height="123">````.
